I'm Roger Hill and my main interests are in Microsoft Dynamics CRM, C#, .Net, JavaScript and testing and CI/CD/devops.

I have been working as an IT professional for many years, with a wealth of experience in many different areas.

Current interests are in doing more work in the MS Power Platform areas, Dynamics Portals, Azure integration and improving the Dynamics CRM devops process.
